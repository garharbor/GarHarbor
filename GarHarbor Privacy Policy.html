  <p>This Privacy Policy explains how GarHarbor (“we”, “our”, “us”) collects, uses, and protects information when using our tools, automations, or integrations.</p>

  <h2>Information We Collect</h2>
  <p>
    Our Pinterest posting automation may access data that you explicitly authorize through Pinterest’s OAuth system. This may include basic account information, access to create posts, and other permitted actions. We do not collect personal data from any other users, nor do we gather information outside what you authorize.
  </p>

  <h2>How We Use Information</h2>
  <p>We use the authorized information strictly to:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Authenticate your Pinterest account</li>
    <li>Upload and schedule pins to your Pinterest boards</li>
    <li>Support the intended functionality of your personal-use automation workflow</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Data Sharing</h2>
  <p>
    We do not sell, share, or disclose your information to third parties. Data is used solely to perform the actions you requested.
  </p>

  <h2>Data Storage</h2>
  <p>
    We do not permanently store personal information. Any temporary authorization data is used only for the active session and is not retained.
  </p>

  <h2>Your Control</h2>
  <p>
    You may revoke access at any time through your Pinterest account settings, which will immediately disable all automated functionality.
  </p>

  <h2>Updates</h2>
  <p>
    We may update this Privacy Policy as needed. Continued use of our tools indicates acceptance of any updated terms.
  </p>
